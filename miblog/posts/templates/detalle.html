  <h2>Learn TensorFlow and deep learning, without a Ph.D.</h2>

      Deep learning (aka neural networks) is a popular approach to building
      machine-learning models that is capturing developer imagination.
      If you want to acquire deep-learning skills but lack the time, I feel your pain.

      In university, I had a math teacher who would yell at me, “Mr. Görner,
      integrals are taught in kindergarten!” I get the same feeling today,
      when I read most free online resources dedicated to deep learning.
      My kindergarten education was apparently severely lacking in
      “dropout lullabies,” “cross-entropy riddles,” and “relu-gru-rnn-lstm
      monster stories.” Yet, these fundamental concepts are taken for granted
      by many, if not most, authors of online educational resources about
      deep learning.

      To help more developers embrace deep-learning techniques, without the
      need to earn a Ph.D., I have attempted to flatten the learning curve
      by building a short crash-course (3 hours total). The course is focused
      on a few basic network architectures, including dense, convolutional
      and recurrent networks, and training techniques such as dropout or batch
      normalization. (This course was initially presented at the Devoxx
      conference in Antwerp, Belgium, in November 2016.)
      By watching the recordings of the course and viewing the annotated slides,
      you can learn how to solve a couple of typical problems with neural
      networks and also pick up enough vocabulary and concepts to continue
      your deep learning self-education — for example, by exploring TensorFlow
      resources. (TensorFlow is Google’s internally developed framework for
      deep learning, which has been growing in popularity since it was released
      as open source in 2015.)
